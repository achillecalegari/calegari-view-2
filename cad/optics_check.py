"""Vignetting check: rays from the lens exit pupil to the four corners of the 6x7 frame, through the
real parts at each shift. Exit code 1 if a case in REQUIRED is clipped.

The pupil of a symmetric wide angle sits near its rear principal plane, about FFD - 5 mm in front of
the film at infinity (z 65 here; PUPIL_Z in params.py is a looser value used only to size openings).
Every printed and bought part between the pupil and the film is sliced every 0.25 mm; a ray is lost
if it passes through solid anywhere. The result is the share of the pupil that reaches each corner.
